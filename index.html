                This week, I've been learning how to use JavaScript promises and functions for flow control management. This is particularly useful when the browser has to load data and delay in display is expected.

                Although the assignment required me to display population information with color or sizes in the map features, I found it quite challenging. Instead, I focused on the initial prompt, where the user selects a continent and the cities within that continent are displayed on the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                I submitted the assignment late because I found the task very challenging. However, the experience pushed me to learn, I gained a deeper understanding of JavaScript promises and functions syntax. Finally, working in CodePen.io and having to publish the resulting application on my GitHub Pages significantly increased my exposure to web development elements, further expanding my programming toolkit.
